# FunBB

This is a web BBS system similar to phpBB and vBulletin. It's first version will have a flat structure for boards, future versions will have a hierarchy. This is a basic system to start and will grow in complexity over time. Initial goals are as follows:

* Login system with simple member/admin permission levels
* flat board structure
* simple admin interface
* no user control panel

## Technology

The standard LAMP stack is being leveraged here. To manage the architecture of the application I am using the [Laravel](http://www.laravel.com) MVC framework. For the front end I am using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) which has a lot of nice features and is a great stepping stone for new projects.

I am [Nick](http://www.nick.gs) and I am writing this to keep my skills fresh and because I often spend a lot of time on the web posting on forums so I thought I would take a crack at making my own.
